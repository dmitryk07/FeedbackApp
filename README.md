# FeedbackApp

You can easily add the "Feedback" application to your web-page and start getting the users references. The references contain the category for performing more profound analysis.
The data is stored as the list and includes the time and contact details of a user who have left the reference. Employing the basic capabilities of SharePoint, you can setup the notifications on the new references posting.
No extra infrastructure and hosting are required for this application.
